# Adding score management to your MOTUS application 

## add a local user management

let's play with localstorare 
test if user is connected and the player name
if not connected, display form that request the name
if connected, display the name and a logout button that remove the data from localstorage

## add a new API 

this api has to implement the route /score that store the score for each user 
- number of word guess
- number of tentative for each diferent word

in this exercice, we will not implement a database (we should)
store this data in a file (JSON format)
