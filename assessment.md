# Microservice : Assessment 

## Overall Goal

The unit will allow you to progressivly build a web application using a microservice architecture.
  
## What

Work will be done in teams of two or three.

Team has to provide by mail a link to a github repository.

It should be finished at the end of the 6th day of the unit.

Target is to have the following functionnalities implemented in a microservice architecture:
- a working motus game 
- a scoring system
- an authentication system


## Assessment criteria 

- **documentation** : 
  - it has to describe the state of the project
  - it has to include diagrams as explanation
  - it has to explain how to run the project 
  - it can explain the next step if you have idea you have not been able to implement 
- projet has to be **working**

- **development and architecture topics** seen during the unit :
  -  at least two microservice ( 2 independant web servers)  working together to handle the score ans the motus
- **extra point** will be given :
  - if the project work correctly with Docker (ie one DockerFile for each microservice, one docker-compose.yml to launch all apps)
  - if a reverse proxy is used
  - if you implement extra functionnality (database, other game, dedicated front server,scoring prediction...) or change one node server to another techno (python flask for example)
  - other effort done by the team
